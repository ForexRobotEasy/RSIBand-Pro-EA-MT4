# RSIBand Pro EA MT4

This is the code for the RSIBand Pro Expert Advisor (EA) in MT4. The EA has been developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and is available for use on the MT4 platform.

## Product Description

The RSIBand Pro EA is an automated trading system that utilizes the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Bollinger Bands indicators to identify potential trading opportunities. It is designed to execute buy or sell orders based on specific market conditions.

To use the RSIBand Pro EA, you need to add the Trade and Indicators libraries to your MT4 platform. The EA will then run on every tick and check for overbought or oversold conditions using the RSI indicator. If an overbought or oversold condition is detected, the EA will further analyze the market using the Bollinger Bands indicator to determine if there is a price reversal.

If a price reversal is identified, the EA will make a trading decision based on the analysis of the RSI and Bollinger Bands. If the market is deemed bullish, a buy order will be executed. If the market is deemed bearish, a sell order will be executed.
